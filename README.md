This project gave you the chance to get some practice with forms and bindings, while also introducing you to DatePicker, Stepper, navigationBarItems(), Date, DateComponents, and DateFormatter – these are things you’ll be using time and time again, so I wanted to get them in nice and early.

Of course, I also took the chance to give you a glimpse of some of the incredible things we can build using Apple’s frameworks, all thanks to Create ML and Core ML. As you saw, these frameworks allow us to take advantage of decades of research and development in machine learning, all using a drag and drop user interface and a couple of lines of code – it really couldn’t be any easier.

The truly fascinating thing about machine learning is that it doesn’t need big or clever scenarios to be used. You could use machine learning to predict used car prices, to figure out user handwriting, or even detect faces in images. And most importantly of all, the entire process happens on the user’s device, in complete privacy.
